Comparing the top 10 search results from Google and DuckDuckGo indicates that there is an average overlap of 2.04 or 20.4%. The average of Spearman Coefficient is -5.384. The negative coefficient indicates that the ranking algorithm used by Google is quite dissimilar to that of DuckDuckGo. However, this can't be conclusively, as repeating this test showed an increase in the average overlap but decrease in the average Spearman Coefficient. This might be the result of the lack of users who use DuckDuckGo in comparison to Google's massive user base.
